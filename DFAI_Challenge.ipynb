        "The given images with pixel data is similar to a data being represented in an array. We can use either \"Nested Lists\" or \"Arrays\" to store this information. But using \"Nested Lists\" would cost a lot of storage, especially for the given large image data (100,000 x 100,000 pixels), as lists can store data of multiple datatypes. While in our case, we want to store either of the 2 values representing each pixel, i.e., \"Black\" for the blob region that is parasite body or the dye region and \"White\" for outside the blob or dye region. This translates to usage of boolean values, where we can use \"Black\" as \"1\" or \"True\" and \"White\" as \"0\" or \"False\". So, we can use \"Numpy Array\" to represent the given images, more spcifically a \"Boolean Array\" since we are only using 2 values, rather than using an \"Integer Array\", since \"Boolean Array\" consume less space than \"Integer Array\" (Boolean array uses 1 Byte of memory per element, and Integer array uses 8 Bytes of memory per element)."
